# Theming

With xstyled, we talk a lot about theming, but what is it? Theming is one of the core feature of [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/). It permits to provide an object accessible by all your styled components, it is the theme!

## How does it work?

xstyled works without any theme, but using a theme really gives super powers! With xstyled, all css properties are directly bound to a theme value (see [theme specification](/docs/theme-specification/) for more detail), so you can rely on theme without thinking about it.

You can setup a custom theme using `ThemeProvider` from `@xstyled/styled-components` or from `styled-components`:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@xstyled/styled-components'
import App from './App'

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#bd4932',
  },
}

const Root = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

By doing this, in all your components, you will be able to use `primary` as a color, the color will be replaced automatically by `#bd4932`.

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components'

const Button = styled.button`
  color: primary;
`
```

## What are the theme keys?

All theme keys are described in [theme specification](/docs/theme-specification/).

## Is there a default theme?

No there is no default theme, but if you don't provide one, xstyled will automatically provides default values for breakpoints, space and font-sizes:

```js
const DEFAULT_BREAKPOINTS = {
  xs: 0,
  sm: 576,
  md: 768,
  lg: 992,
  xl: 1200,
}

const DEFAULT_SPACE = [0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240]

const DEFAULT_FONT_SIZES = [0, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 72]
```

Concretely, it means that if you specify `margin: 2` it will be transformed to `margin: 8px` without adding any theme.

If defaults don't fit your needs, just replace them in the theme.
