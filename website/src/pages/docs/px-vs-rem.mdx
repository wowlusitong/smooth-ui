# Pixels vs Rem

[Using `rem` is always better for accessiblity](https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px), but it is very hard to implement a complete design using `rem` unit because most of design tools are not ready for it. For example, Sketch displays pixels instead of rem.

xstyled solves this problem by providing a new unit `rpx`. When you use `rpx` as unit, all your pixels are automatically converted in rem. It uses a base of `1rem = 16px`, the default on modern browsers.

## Use `rpx` in styled components

`rpx` is supported in the majority of CSS properties.

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components'

const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 20rpx;
  line-height: 24rpx;
`

// This code will output:
// font-size: 1.25rem;
// line-height: 1.5rem;
```

## Use `rpx` with `th` utility

If you don't use `@xstyled/components` or for special cases like `calc` you can use `th.px` utility to handle `rpx` unit.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { th } from '@xstyled/system'

const Title = styled.h1`
  width: calc(100% + ${th.px('20rpx')});
`

// This code will output:
// width: calc(100% + 1.25rem);
```
