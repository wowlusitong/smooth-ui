# System

What we called system is a set of utilities that gives you a real power. It ensures consistency in your design and reduce the amount of code to produce things.

## System as props

The first usage of system, firstly introduced by [styled-system](https://styled-system.com) are system props.

To start, you have to pick utilities from `@styled/system` and create a styled component.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { color, backgroundColor } from '@xstyled/system'

const Box = styled.div`
  ${color}
  ${backgroundColor}
`

export default Box
```

This component now handles all system properties:

```js
<Box color="primary" backgroundColor="#fff" />
```

It handles any valid colors, but also reads them from your theme:

```js
// theme.js
export default {
  colors: {
    primary: 'red',
  },
}
```

## System as getters

System as prop is very useful, but you could prefer to use it in the style declaration of your component. `@xstyled/system` exposes all getters, this way you can use them to create styled components.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { th } from '@xstyled/system'

const PrimaryBox = styled.div`
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: ${th.color('primary')};
`

export default PrimaryBox
```

It acts exactly like props but right in your style declaration.

## System as styled

System can also be used seemlessly in your CSS. `@xstyled/styled-components` is a wrapper around `styled-components` that gives you this power:

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components'

const PrimaryBox = styled.div`
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: primary;
`

export default PrimaryBox
```

The above example reads `primary` from `theme.colors`.
