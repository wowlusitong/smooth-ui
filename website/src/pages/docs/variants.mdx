# Variants

The `variant` utility from `@xstyled/system` makes variant based components easy to create.

## Without variant utility

Variant are supported out of the box by `styled-components`. Let's create a button with two variants:

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  ${p => !p.variant || p.variant === 'primary' && css`
    color: red;
  `}
  ${p => p.variant === 'secondary' && css`
    color: blue;
  `}
`

<Button variant="secondary" />
```

As you can see the code is kind of messy. `variant` utility will help you to fix that.

## With variant utility

The variant utility handles all complexity for you:

```js
import { variant } from '@xstyled/system'

const Button = styled.button`
  ${variant({
    default: 'primary',
    variants: {
      primary: css`
        color: red;
      `,
      secondary: css`
        color: blue;
      `
    }
  })}
`

<Button variant="secondary" />
```

As you can see the code is cleaner, adding a variant is easy!

## Use another prop

`variant` are useful for a lot of things, for example, the button could also have different sizes.

```js
import { variant } from '@xstyled/system'

const sizeVariants = variant({
  default: 'md',
  prop: 'size',
  variants: {
    md: css`
      padding: 8px;
    `,
    lg: css`
      padding: 16px;
    `
  }
})

const Button = styled.button`
  ${sizeVariants}
`

<Button size="md" />
```

## Read variants from the theme

Sometimes, you may want to specify variants in your theme. The `key` option gives you that possibility:

```js
import { variant } from '@xstyled/system'

const Button = styled.button`
  ${variant({
    key: 'buttons'
    default: 'primary',
  })}
`
```

In your theme:

```js
// theme.js
export default {
  buttons: {
    primary: css`
      color: red;
    `,
    secondary: css`
      color: blue;
    `,
  },
}
```

All your variants are read from your theme!
