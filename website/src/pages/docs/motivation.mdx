# Motivation

Two years ago, I discovered [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), it was a game changer for all my projects. At Smooth Code, we adopted it and it has significantly reduced development time. A year later, I discovered [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system); it was a great discovery! Being able to style your components directly from props in a consistent way is so powerful.

styled-system is great, so great that I wanted to add it in the core of [Smooth UI](https://smooth-ui.smooth-code.com). Unfortunately it wasn't performant enough to be added in the core of the library. That's why I decided to rewrite it. I optimized it, added a bunch of features, and fixed things.

For the record, [I contributed to styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/pull/479). I refactored the codebase, introduce tree shaking and severals features... Unfortunately, Brent Jackson's vision was not as close to mine as expected. That's why I decided to create xstyled. It follows the styled-system specification, but it evolves faster and gives me more freedom!

After one year using system based props in our code, we've pushed it to the next step: being able to use the system right in CSS props. It provides significant time-savings!
